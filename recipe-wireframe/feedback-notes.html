		<h1>Wireframe Feedback - 10/10/18</h1>

		<h2>Bersabeh & Katie:</h2>

		<p>Shopping List as language is a little confusing.</p>
		<p>--Seems very intrusive/commanding.</p>
		<p>--But I still like it, so maybe it's alright.</p>

		<br>

		<p>The flow of the steps and the imagery is nice and guides the eye.</p>
		<p>Consider using small images for the Shopping List to further hint at what an object is.</p>
		<p>The navigation bar concept is cool. Featuring "return to top" "and all of the step icons.</p>
		<p>Have somesort of integration in which as you scroll down the page, your current step is highlighted.</p>

		<br>

		<h2>My own thoughts:</h2>
		<p>Consider using a grid to make elements better aligned.</p>
		<p>Transition to XD and using actual images to get a better feel.</p>
		<p>Think about illustrations needed/A consistent aesthetic for such.</p>
