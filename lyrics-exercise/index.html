	<p>
	I know you're trying<br>
	</p>

	<p class="leadings">	
	<i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Everything and nothing always haunts me<br>
	I know you're trying, I know you're trying<br>
	Waiting for your moment to fall on me<br>
	I saw you trying, I saw you trying<br>
	</p>

	<p class="leadings">	
	<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Maybe if you let me be your lover<br>
	Maybe if you tried, then I would not bother<br>
	Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me<br>
	<br>
	Everything is true to me, never words where you would see<br>
	Maybe if you let me be your lover<br>
	Maybe if you tried, then I would not bother<br>
	</p>

	<p class="leadings">	
	<i>[Interlude]</i><br>

	<p>
	I know you're trying<br>
	I know you're trying<br>
	</p>

	<i>[Verse 2]</i><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Hurts so bad, I don't know what you want from me<br>
	You know I'm trying, you know I'm trying<br>
	And now we're hanging on by a heartbeat<br>
	You know I'm trying, I was always trying<br>
	</p>

	<p class="leadings">	
	<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Maybe if you let me be your lover<br>

	Everything is true to me, never words where you would see<br>
	<br>
	Maybe if you let me be your lover<br>
	Maybe if you tried, then I would not bother<br>
	I've been hating everything, everything that could have been<br>
	Could have been my anything, now everything's embarrassing<br>
	</p>

	<p class="leadings">
	<i>[Bridge]</i><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Acting like it's nothing; such a bore<br>
	I saw the truth and I just can't ignore<br>
	You're trying to hold the heart that you once tore, oh<br>
	<br>
	Say I tried to give my best before<br>
	You wouldn't have the chance to give me more<br>
	You're only one step closer to the door<br>
	</p>
