	<h1>Postcard Feedback for Sarah<h1>
	<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The design works. It isn't necessarily remarkable though.</li>
		<li>Images and text do support the overall content of the cards</li>
		<li>There is evident cohesion among the postcards</li>
		<li>The text is legible, however in some moments it becomes slightly harder to read</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Structure</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Perhaps your visual hierarchy isn't working the way you want. It's easy for me to get stuck in the background, but not for a long time.</li>
		<li>The design elements are working together well. They could be improved, but they work.</li>
		<li>The Jim quote/image may make it weird/hard to read on phone sizes because of how busy the foreground is.</li>
		<li>You have an established structure for foreground/background with your slightly blurry backgrounds. This can be seen in the first and third mockups, but this rule is not as apparent in the second.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The text on all of the versions are fitting. But on the michael scott quote, the text on the blinds is a little bit too much.</li>
		<li>The images are at a decent resolution, but could be better</li>
	</ul>
