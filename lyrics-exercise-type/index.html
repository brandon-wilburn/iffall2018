	<p class="header">[Verse: bearface]</p>
	<p>Was I more than it's worth</p>
	<p>Or will you see my name and I'll fade?</p>
	<p>Pitch my camp in your mind</p>
	<p>Sat by the fire, behind your eyes</p>
	<p>And I'll look through them just once or twice</p>
	<p>But I might see something I don't like</p>
	<p>Like your hands in his shirt</p>
	<p>Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk</p>

	<br>

	<p class="header">[Chorus: bearface & No Rome]</p>
	<p>Losing my way, ohh</p>
	<p>Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
	<p>(No worries) Losing my way, ohh</p>
	<p>Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy</p>
	<p>Seeing your name</p>
	<p>Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry</p>
	<p>But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah (no worries)</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah (no worries)</p>
	<p>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
	
	<br>

	<p class="header">[Outro: bearface]</p>
	<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh</p>
	<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</p>
	<p>Oh-oh-oh-ooh</p>
	<p>Oh-oh-ooh</p>
	<p>Oh-oh-oh-ooh</p>
